# What is it?

This is an advanced configuration of termux x11, rich in features to be highly functional, 
good looking, highly customizable and with very good optimization, this was inspired by @Manjaro [manjaro-site](https://manjaro.org) and from @adi1090x 's [termux-desktop](https://github.com/adi1090x/termux-desktop) , resulting in a highly useful and optimized desktop.

### Less apps ?, I have made a configuration to run the apps of a proot distro in termux native desktop. An example:

```
./start-ubuntu.sh
apt install firefox
export DISPLAY=:1
firefox 
```

### You can run proot apps without problems

# Installation

! Only in termux

```bash
curl -sLf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0nsec/Termux-desktop/main/boostrap.sh | bash
```

After that just have a cup of coffee... the script will do its job 

# Usage
Run:

```bash
vncserver -listen tcp 
```

To start the vnc server, connect to localhost: 1 Or the port indicated by the terminal.
